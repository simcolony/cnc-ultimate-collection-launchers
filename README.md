Hey guys,
I would like to ask if anyone of you could give me the Origin IDs of the games of The Ultimate Collection for others than the English version and the locale shortcut. The information can be found in the registry.

The IDs are listed in: "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\[Wow6432Node]\Origin Games"
The locale shortcut can be found in the key of the ID or in: "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\[Wow6432Node]\EA Games\"


English Version
